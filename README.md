JDBC-CRUD-Operation-Perform
JDBC is nothing but java database connectivity. JDBC is usually used for connection build up in between the java application and database server with help of JDBC API. and also we can say it will able to interact between the java application and database server with the help of JDBC API.
Here I have a create java project based on JDBC( Java database connectivity ) with the help of console we give the command (like CRUD Operation) add & delete & save & exit. 
They all CRUD operation performe well with behind logic i used. this project specially is we directly save and delete the data in console. and it support the Execution Plan (Execution plan means compile one and execute many time).
